    <h1>Additional Material for Public Key Cryptography</h1>

    <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>
      Public key cryptography is powerful for blockchain because it allows us to prove a message has been sent from a certain person holding a specific private key. This is a step in the direction of establishing identity in a peer-to-peer way. Remember, a blockchain protocol is trying to provide what banks or governments have previously provided but without those institutions as intermediaries. What public key cryptography does is mathematically prove a certain person holds a certain key.
    </p>

    <h2>Consequences</h2>
    <p>
      However, there's a big issue here. There's no way to determine who holds the key, just if they have the key. We are assuming the private key equals the owner of the assets, but what if someone steals your private key? This is a big security and user-experience issue for people come into the blockchain and cryptocurrency world. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As consumers, users are probably used to being able to reset their passwords, recover their funds if there's fraud, or at least reach out to a service and get assistance in case of trouble. At its most basic, with users handling their own private keys, almost all of this disappears. 
    </p>
    <p>  
      Even more troubling, regardless of the amount of messaging a user receives about protecting their private keys, many may not understand there is no safety net until it is too late. And for those users who are experienced, there are so many bad habits we've all developed as consumers which are hard to break.

      All this to say: <a href="https://twitter.com/danfinlay/status/1386474006937706496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Not trusting is expensive.</a> Please be aware of how expensive it is, not only for yourself, but also for your users. Luckily, at the end of this section, we'll walk through some basic security considerations that <b>anyone</b> in the crypto space should adopt from Day 1

    <p>Okay! Parental lecture over, stepping off of soapbox, and now time to play with some public keys cryptography!</p>
