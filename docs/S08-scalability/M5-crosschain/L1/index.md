From Peter Robinson:

With regards Similarly, there is no one blockchain to rule them all. There are public permissionless blockchains such as Ethereum Mainnet, Bitcoin, and Filecoin. There are many instances of permissioned, consortium blockchains such as Enterprise Ethereum / Quorum, Corda and Hyperledger Fabric. Within the public permissionless Ethereum space, Sidechains and Roll-ups (L2s) are emerging to improve scalability. All of these technologies need Crosschain Communications to allow them to communicate. Even if the world settled on one blockchain technology platform, all data and all functionality is unlikely to reside on just one instance of the blockchain platform.
