# Intro to L2s and Scalability

Ethereum gas fees have risen astronomically as the network becomes more popular. The ability of retail investors to participate in new Ethereum-based offerings like DeFi is circumscribed by the ever-increasing cost of entry into the space. As a result, some users and products are migrating to other chains that offer lower costs. If Ethereum is to maintain its dominance and network effect, it must scale. 


## Terminology

In the following sections, we're going to give a way to gauge any Layer 2, sidechain, crosschain or bridge solution. We're also going to go through some of the _types_ of Layer 2 solutions, then walk through examples of popular Layer 2 solutions. We're then going to talk about crosschain and blockchain interoperability. Finally, we're going to have live sessions and presentations based around L2 platforms such as Polygon, Optimism and more.

In this section, we'll typically refer to mainnet Ethereum as Layer 1 or L1 and whatever the scaling solution is as a Layer 2 solution (L2), a sidechain, sidechannel or a bridge.

## Conclusion

These are exciting and very new topics, please be aware that they are considered *very* cutting edge and you should be extremely careful when using them. Also, please know that the documentation changes very regularly and perhaps not perceptibly. If you're currently building on a Layer 2 solution, we recommend joining the project's Discord, or wherever the community gathers, and making sure to follow their developer updates.
