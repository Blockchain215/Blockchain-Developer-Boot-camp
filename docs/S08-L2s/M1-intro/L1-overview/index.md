# Intro to L2s and Scalability

--reason for needing this (expensive, slow transactions on mainnet)

--"galaxy of multichains" theory

## Terminology

--in the following sections, we're going to give a way to gauge any Layer 2, sidechain, crosschain or bridge solution. We're also going to go through some of the _types_ of Layer 2 solutions, then walk through examples of popular Layer 2 solutions.

--We're then going to talk about crosschain and blockchain interoperability. 

--finally, we're going to have live sessions and presentations based around L2 platforms such as Polygon, NEAR, SKALE and more

## Conclusion

These are exciting and very new topics, please be aware that they are considered *very* cutting edge and you should be extremely careful when using them. Also, please know that the documentation changes very regularly and perhaps not perceptibly. If you're currently building on a Layer 2 solution, we recommend joining the project's Discord, or wherever the community gathers, and making sure to follow their developer updates.

Let's dive in!
