  <h1>Ethereum History and Background</h1>
  
  <!-- Content here: -->

  <p>In our last section, when discussing how to analyze new blockchain networks you encounter, we recommended you ask, "Why does this network exist?" Well, we think it's important to drink our own potions, so we'd like to ask that question of Ethereum: Why does it exist?</p>

  <p>We'll do a brief overview of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Ethereum network,</a> including its history, but we'll dive deeper into all of this material over the rest of the course.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vitalik Buterin</a>, a co-founder of Ethereum, was an active part of the Bitcoin community, including writing for <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/vitalik-buterin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin Magazine.</a> He and others in the community had become interested in developing more computing capacity for the Bitcoin network. As we learned in a previous section, Bitcoin does have a programming language, <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Script.</a> Projects such as <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colored Coins</a> and <a href="https://www.rsk.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSK</a> have tried to introduce extra programming capacity on top of the Bitcoin Network. Buterin and others researched this and decided to build their own network, which would become Ethereum.</p>

  <h2>Launch of Ethereum</h2>
    <p>Ethereum ran a pre-sale to fund its development </p>

  <h2>Development of the Network: EIPs, ERCs</h2>

  <h2>Ethereum 2.0</h2>
