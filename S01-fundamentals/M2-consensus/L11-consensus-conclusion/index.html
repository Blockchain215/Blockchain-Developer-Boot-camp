  <h1>Consensus Conclusion</h1>

    <!-- Content here: -->
  <p>Hopefully by now you feel like you have a sense of how distributed consensus works in a traditional network and how blockchains have innovated consensus protocols. While cryptographic primitives allow blockchain users to secure and validate current transactions, blockchain consensus protocols allow for a blockchain network to maintain a public ledger (the global state of the blockchain) in a decentralized way.</p>


  <h2>Challenges of Consensus in Distributed Networks</h2>
  
  <p>While blockchain consensus protocols have made great strides in decentralized networks, there are still some unsolved issues they're facing. Some of these (like the CAP theorem and forks) affect all general distributed networks while others, like Miner Extracted Value and 51% attacks, are specific to public blockchains. Here's a sampling and brief description of these challenges.</p>

    <p></p>

    concerns of distributed consensus:
    --CAP
    --forks
    --51% attacks (PoW specific)
    --MEV


  Overall takeaway: the trustless consensus protocols, as kicked off by Proof of Work, is the last primitive we need in our mental model to complete our blockchain framework. We'll walk through a few more examples of proof of work implementations, then
