  <h1>Consensus Conclusion</h1>

  <p>Hopefully by now you feel like you have a sense of how distributed consensus works in a traditional network and how blockchains have innovated consensus protocols. While cryptographic primitives allow blockchain users to secure and validate current transactions, trustless consensus allows for a blockchain network to maintain a public ledger (the global state of the blockchain) in a decentralized way.</p>

  <p>We've spoken mainly about Proof of Work, since it's the current consensus mechanism for Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as other blockchains. However, there are other consensus protocols being used by blockchain networks which we will discuss later, such as:

    <ul>
      <li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proof of Stake</a></b> A consensus protocol based on financial holdings of validator nodes in the network (similar to miner nodes in Proof of Work). Proof of Stake requires much less energy to run than Proof of Work and, for this reason, Ethereum is currently working towards this consensus mechanism.</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake#Variations_of_stake_definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delegated Proof of Stake</a></b> This is a variant of the Proof of Stake protocol in which stakeholders can elect validators to represent them in the system.</li>
      <li><b>Proof of Authority</b> This is a more traditional consensus mechanism like Raft's leader-led consensus in which only certain nodes are allowed to produce blocks at their discretion. It's meant for smaller, perhaps private networks where the participants all know each other or for lower-stake networks such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testnets</a> or networks securing trivial amounts of value.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <p>We'll discuss these consensus mechanisms again when going over different blockchain configurations</p>

    concerns of distributed consensus:
    --CAP
    --forks
    --51% attacks (PoW specific)
    --MEV


  Overall takeaway: the trustless consensus protocols, as kicked off by Proof of Work, is the last primitive we need in our mental model to complete our blockchain framework. We'll walk through a few more examples of proof of work implementations, then
