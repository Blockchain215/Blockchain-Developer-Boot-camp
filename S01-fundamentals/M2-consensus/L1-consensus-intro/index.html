  <h1>Distributed Coordination: Consensus Protocols</h1>
  
  <!-- Content here: -->

  <p>After learning about cryptography, we know how create a identity, how to make sure no one has messed with a file, and how to capture a user's intent all in a decentralized peer-to-peer way. This all well and good for current interactions or things we are doing <i>now</i> on a network, but how do we agree on things that have happened in the past? That is, how do actors in a network we coordinate and agree on the series of events that have led to the current state of the network? How do we know someone really <i>does</i> have digital money they can send to us and are not making it up? How do all the actors in the network then maintain that knowledge in a secure way? This is what we're going to learn in this module.</p>

  <p>To understand how all the actors in a network can coordinate and agree about the historical state of a blockchain network we will learn about <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consensus</a></b>. Distributed consensus is not only used in blockchain, to be clear. Any internet service that needs to coordinate their servers all over the globe (which is all the major internet services) uses distributed consensus mechanisms to make that happen. Blockchain takes traditional distributed consensus one step further. We'll see what that step is once we understand the historical and fundamental principles of distributed computing.</p>

  <p>(Note: In this section, we will use the terms <b>Distributed Computing</b>, <b>Distributed Systems</b>, <b>Distributed Consensus</b>, and <b>Distributed Coordination</b> interchangeably. We'll also be speaking about consensus strictly in the computer scientific sense. Later in the course, we'll discuss consensus among people in a network, typically called <b>governance</b>.)</p>

  <h2>Development of Distributed Computing </h2>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distributed Computing</a> became an important field of study in the 1970s when airplanes started using electronic control systems. Airline manufacturers wanted to make sure that if an certain part of the electronics gave out while the plane was in the air, the whole plane wouldn't shut down. In the scenario of an airplane, the "bad actor" is not a hacker trying to purposefully disable the entire airplane, but rather a single part that is not behaving as it should. As a result, researchers began researching and developing <b>consensus protocols</b> for the airplane computer systems.</p>

  <p>At the most basic level, "consensus protocols are used to allow computers to work together" and "let different servers agree on the state of a system." (<a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/03/26/consensus-systems-with-ethan-buchman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Engineering Daily</a>). For the airplane manufacturers, a good consensus protocol would continue to function with some errors. This way, if one or two things failed, the entire system wouldn't fail. The ability of a consensus protocol to adapt to failure is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilience_(network)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resilience.</a> </p> 

  <p>Crucially, early work around distributed computing and consensus protocols dealt with <i>non-adversarial systems</i>. This meant that any of the faults that were happening in a computer network, like an airplane, were the result of natural system errors (power failure, faulty parts, etc), not some sort of active meddling or hacking.</p>

  <p>One of the most important pioneers in the early field of distributed computing and consensus protocols was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leslie Lamport.</a> Lamport developed a series of concepts we still reference today in discussing consensus protocols including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Clocks</b> The notion of time is very important in a distributed system as it creates a sort of order for the larger system. Ordering events that occur in a system is particularly important. Think about making breakfast, for example. If your mix up the order of a series of actions, like eating your eggs before you cook them, it can create chaos and confusion. <a href="https://dean.eigenmann.me/blog/2020/01/06/time-clocks-and-order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's an article</a> from Dean Eigenmann discussing Lamport's ideas of Time, Clocks and Order.</li>
    <li><b>Fault Tolerance</b> This is a formal description of resilience: How many mistakes can a system tolerate before it will collapse completely? Lamport proposed a thought experiment to test the limits of fault tolerance called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Byzantine General's Problem.</a> We discussed it briefly in the video before. Essentially, the most amount of fault a distributed network can absorb is one-third. So, if 2/3rds of a system are still available and coordinating, the system can still run.</li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>



  <p>The main takeaway we'd like you to have from this section is distributed consensus originally only dealt systems that were </p>
