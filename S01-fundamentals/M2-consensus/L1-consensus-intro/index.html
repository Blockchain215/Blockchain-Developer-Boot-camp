  <h1>Distributed Coordination: Consensus</h1>
  
  <!-- Content here: -->

  <p>After learning about cryptography, we know how create a identity, how to make sure no one has messed with a file, and how to capture a user's intent all in a decentralized peer-to-peer way. This all well and good for current interactions or things we are doing <i>now</i> on a network, but how do we agree on things that have happened in the past? That is, how do actors in a network we coordinate and agree on the series of events that have led to the current state of the network? How do we know someone really <i>does</i> have digital money they can send to us and are not making it up? How do all the actors in the network then maintain that knowledge in a secure way? This is what we're going to learn in this module.</p>

  <p>To understand how all the actors in a network can coordinate and agree about the historical state of a blockchain network we will learn about <b>consensus</b>. </p>
