  <h1>Truffle Suite Deep Dive</h1>
  
  <!-- Content here: -->

  <p>As with most things, the best way to learn is by doing, so without further ado let’s dive into a hands on example of using Truffle.</p>

  <p>In this example we’ll be leveraging some of the core Truffle commands to build the decentralized equivalent of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Hello World!” program,</a> “SimpleStorage”. As the name suggests, this example will provide a means of both storing some on-chain data (essentially state stored indefinitely on the blockchain) and subsequently retrieving this state.</p>

  <p><i>Note: If you’re going to be following along, this example assumes you followed the steps last lesson to successfully install Truffle</i></p>

  <h2>Initialize an Empty Project</h2>

    <p>Let’s begin by creating an empty project using the <code>init</code> command. In a new directory (e.g. “SimpleStorage”) and from your terminal, run the following command.</p>

    <pre>$ truffle init</pre>

    <p>Assuming everything worked successfully you should see the following output and a number of directories (contracts, migrations, etc) created in the current directory.</p>

    <pre>
      Starting init...
      ================
      
      > Copying project files to /Users/bluer/Developer/temp
      
      Init successful, sweet!
      
      Try our scaffold commands to get started:
        $ truffle create contract YourContractName # scaffold a contract
        $ truffle create test YourTestName         # scaffold a test
      
      http://trufflesuite.com/docs
    </pre>

    <p>Congratulations, you now have a bare bones project! Next up, let’s create a contract within which we’ll be able to store our SimpleStorage project’s code.</p>

  <h2>Create a Contract</h2>  

    <p>Truffle provides a create command with which you can achieve this, although as we'll show later it’s often just as easy to create the file via your favorite editor environment.</p>

    <pre>$ truffle create contract SimpleStorage</pre>


    <p>This will create a new Solidity (note that this is the default language) file, <code>SimpleStorage.sol</code> within your contracts directory.</p>

    <p>Using a code editor, or using something like <code>nano</code> from the command line, paste the following Solidity code into the <code>SimpleStorage.sol</code> file and save:</p>

    <pre>

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.4.21 <0.7.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
  uint storedData;

  function set(uint x) public {
    storedData = x;
  }

  function get() public view returns (uint) {
    return storedData;
  }
}
      
    </pre>

    <p>Sweet, your first contract! Now let’s try out the <code>compile</code> command we saw earlier.</p>

  <h2>Compilation, baby!</h2>
  
    <p>Running the <code>compile</code> command from your terminal like the following:</p>

    <pre>
  $ truffle compile

  Compiling your contracts...
  ===========================
  > Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol
  > Compiling ./contracts/SimpleStorage.sol
  > Artifacts written to /Users/bluer/Developer/temp/build/contracts
  > Compiled successfully using:
    - solc: 0.5.16+commit.9c3226ce.Emscripten.clang
    </pre>

    <p>Assuming all went smoothly, Truffle should have compiled your contract and added the resultant output (something referred to as build <b>artifacts</b> that we’ll explore in more detail later) to <code>build/contracts/SimpleStorage.json</code>.</p>

    <p><i>Note that you’ll also likely see some references to <b>Migrations.</b> This is a mechanism used by Truffle to store the details related to the last migration (deployment) on-chain. </i></p>

    <p>Next up we’re going to explore deploying our contract to a simulation of a blockchain network using <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache">Ganache.</a></p>
